# **IOT-Smartcity**
---
This is a college semester project aimed to model the several facets of  **Smartcity** intitiative. The System includes various modules like **Smart Traffic Management, Smart Street Lights, Smart Parking System** and _some other components_ of a smart city.

## Synopsis
---
* The System includes **Web-based service, an Android App and Arduino controlled sesnsors and other circuitry.**
* **Other Salient Features**  
    1. A **Smart Street Light system** that switches on only when it senses a vehicle in its close proximity, thereby saving electrical energy.
    2. **Smart Parking facility** that can be easily located by the user. User can check for available parking slots.
    3. A **Smart Irrigation system** that checks the water content/moisture in soil and if the water content is critically low, it will provide water to the plants.
    4. We have implemented a **pollution monitoring system** that checks the air for infiltration and also notifies user if the level of carbon in air is beyond the permissible amount.
    5. A **Smart Traffic Control system** that enforces traffic rules and notifies the traffic authorities if someone violates the rules.
